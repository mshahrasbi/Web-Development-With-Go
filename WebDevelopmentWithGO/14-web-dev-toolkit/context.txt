What is the package context? and what an you do with it?
Context is exactly what it says, what is the context of what Iam
working with. So context allows when a request comes into your server you can create a context you can create
add to that context you could add some session variable so maybe like the session id and then you could pass that context 
around through your system and most importantly whn that context is finished so you might have that request come in and
other processes might be spawned as part of that request like go get this data get that data and you can set parameters
and limits on this request right this context. The context of this request is you have got 5 seconds to get that data otherwise
we are done, while this request is over here working on getting the data it can communicate back. All the processes can communicate back
likewise if we cancelled on process like if this got fullfilled or destroyed or whatever and we had some other process running over here 
all these processes would shut down.
You don't want to use context as a place to stuff a lot of data and then pass that data around. You still want to pass your data around 
but what you can do, request gobe data that transit's processes and API is not for passing optional paramteres to functions. So you know 
something like your session Id, I think would be accesptable to put into context but then also being able to set deadline right and then
also being able to signal the other processes when they cancel that everything should cancel, that is related to this context that is what 
context is used.
