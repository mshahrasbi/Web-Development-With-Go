# Web storage

Use cookies for secure storage.

Cookies have been around longer and have been built for secure storage.

Web storage is the relative new comer. There are some articles that talk about it being compromised.

## Session storage
Available only during the current session

## Local storage
Available until explicitly deleted

you access web storage with js, so somebody might turn off cookies or not want cookies and they might say no to JS
in which case you are hosed, you have to stick everything in URL, you have to stick that UUID into all of the links
of the URL and make sure your HTTPS so everything is secure and encoded in transit.
So local storage and session storage collectively know as web storage which requires JS to access that area of the
browser.
The difference between the local storage and session storage is that session storage after you close your window is 
going to be cleared out. so after you close your browser that session is over everything is gone.
Local storage will continue to persist until explicitly deleted.
