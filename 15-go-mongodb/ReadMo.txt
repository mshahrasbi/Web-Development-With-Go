to be able to import and use our own package we are doing these steps:
package models
:

step 1: copy the folder 'models' into the 'C:\Users\Mohammad.Shahrasbi\go\src' [since our box is set the go in c folder and our pkg also is in 'src' folder]
step 2: when we run the project, go will create a 'models.a' in 'C:\Users\Mohammad.Shahrasbi\go\pkg\windows_amd64' folder
